        <h4 class="text-success">What is DOM? Purpose of DOM</h4>
        <p>Document object model is referred to as DOM. It is a programming interface for online documents that shows the HTML or XML content as a network of nodes and objects in the form of a tree. An element, property, or passage of text in the document is represented by each node in the tree. 
          With the DOM, you may dynamically change the text content of web pages and add, remove, or edit elements and their characteristics. This enables the creation of dynamic, interactive web pages that may respond to user input and offer a rich user experience.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-success">How to select elements from DOM?</h4>
        <p><ul>
          <li>getElementById: This method selects an element with a specific ID attribute. <code>const element = document.getElementById('myId');</code></li>
          <li>getElementsByClassName: This method selects all elements with a specific class name. <code>const elements = document.getElementsByClassName('myClass');</code></li>
          <li>getElementsByTagName: This method selects all elements with a specific tag name. <code>const elements = document.getElementsByTagName('div');
          </code></li>
          <li>querySelector: This method selects the first element that matches a specific CSS selector. <code>const element = document.querySelector('#myId .myClass');
          </code></li>
          <li>querySelectorAll: This method selects all elements that match a specific CSS selector. <code>const elements = document.querySelectorAll('div.myClass');
          </code></li>
        </ul></p>
        <h4 class="text-success">What is EVENT Bubble ?</h4>
        <p>Event bubbling is a mechanism in which events in the Document Object Model (DOM) can propagate up or down the DOM tree. When an event occurs on an element, such as a mouse click or keypress, the event is first triggered on that element, and then it propagates up the DOM tree to its parent elements, one by one, until it reaches the top level of the document.</p>
        <h4 class="text-success">What is Call Back function and working process</h4>
        <p>A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and is then called back later when the initial function has finished its work. The callback function is typically used to perform some kind of action on the result of the initial function, or to handle an event that occurs later on. </p>
